Lift (A => B) = 1 means that there is no correlation within the itemset.
Lift (A => B) > 1 means that there is a positive correlation within the itemset, i.e., products in the itemset, A, and B, are more likely to be bought together.
Lift (A => B) < 1 means that there is a negative correlation within the itemset, i.e., products in itemset, A, and B, are unlikely to be bought together.
